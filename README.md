## Usage Limits and Best Practices
üö¶ Usage Limits
Free/BASIC plan: Limited daily/monthly requests.

Rate Limit: RapidAPI enforces rate limits by plan level.

Hitting your limit returns a 429 Too Many Requests error.

‚úîÔ∏è Best Practices
Use pagination (limit, page) to avoid large payloads.

Use mini_info when you only need basic title info.

Cache responses from static endpoints (e.g., genres, top-rated).

Retry failed requests after short delay if you hit rate limits.

Avoid redundant queries by using titles-by-ids for batch fetches.
